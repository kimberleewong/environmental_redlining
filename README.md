## About

This repository houses a notebook that shows the process of determining if the 1930's Home Owners’ Loan Corporation's (HOLC) redlining affect our observations of biodiversity. The  neighborhoods were rated based on their perceived safety for real estate investment. Their ranking system, (A (green), B (blue), C (yellow), D (red)) was then used to block access to loans for home ownership. By visualizing the redlining data of Los Angeles, California and using observation bird data, we can confirm or deny whether or not neighborhoods that were historically graded low also have love bird populations.

## Highlights
- Utilize EJScreen tool
- Manipulate vector and raster data to build multi-layer maps
- Use tmap to make maps
